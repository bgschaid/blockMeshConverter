# blockMeshConverter
BlockMeshConverter is an python application for converting 2D BlockMeshDict to a 3d blockMesh dict appropriate for blockMesh utility of OpenFOAM.
To use it you need to create a blockMeshDict similar to standard blockMeshDict in OpenFOAM. However instead of using 3D points and blocks you need to define 2D poinst and blocks.
Then using the blockMeshConverter you will be able to extrued or rotate 2D blockMesh to 3D blockMeshDict.
